PHXibit is a lightweight, easy-to-use, CMS (content 
management system) with an eye towards artists.

PHXibit allows its users to build and mantain a
website to show works, exhibitions, publication and
more, without the hassle of writing a single line
of programming code.

Installing PHXibit is easy:
1) copy the index.php file and the install directory
in your hosting, e.g. in a directory called "phxibit"
under the ftp root directory;
2) go with you browser to the corresponding URL,
e.g. http://www.awesomeartist.net/phxibit;
3) fill in the required fields in the installation form
and click the "create" button. For most of the fields
the default value will work just fine.
Voila', you just created your PHXibit website.

To manage the contents and the appearance of your website,
go to the administration panel, e.g.
http://www.awesomeartist.net/phxibit/admin using the password
chosen in the previous step.
